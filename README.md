README

This Java program lets the user choose a shape to print using stars (`*`). The available shapes are:

1. HalfRightTriangle
2. InvertedHalfLeftTriangle
3. InvertedHalfRightTriangle
4. LeftRightTriangle
5. HollowSquare

How It Works
- The user selects a shape by entering a number (1-5).
- The corresponding shape is printed on the screen.
- If an invalid number is entered, the program shows "Invalid option."

 Functions
- UserPicks(int a)**: Calls the method for the chosen shape.
- HalfRightTriangle(int n)**: Prints a right-aligned triangle.
- InvertedHalfLeftTriangle(int n)**: Prints an inverted left-aligned triangle.
- InvertedHalfRightTriangle(int n)**: Prints an inverted right-aligned triangle.
- LeftRightTriangle(int n)**: Prints a left-aligned triangle.
- HollowSquare(int n)**: Prints a hollow square.

The shapes are printed with 5 stars in size.
